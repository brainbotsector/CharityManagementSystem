   <h1>Transparency</h1>
   <h2>Our commitment to transparency</h2>
   <p>We aim to deliver lasting change for the people and communities we work with. To achieve this, we need to be open about what we do, so our donors and supporters can trust us to spend their money wisely, and the people, communities and partners we work with can help make our shared work as effective as possible.
   Over these years, we’ve built our reputation on trust and results. We are always willing to learn from things that didn’t go so well, in order to improve our performance and increase our impact in the future.
   </p>
   <h2>Fundraising</h2>
   <p>We make this pledge to our supporters:
   	<ul>
   	<li>We will always respect your privacy; if you prefer not to be contacted by certain methods please let us know.
    <li>We will always protect your data; we will not sell your personal details or swap them with any other organisation.
    <li>We have a supporter Bet On Better team who are dedicated to you. We always love to hear from you.
    <li>We will share stories of how your support is helping to change lives for the better.
    <li>We will be honest with you. If we face challenges or make a mistake we will let you know; we are always learning.
    <li>We are accountable to the people we reach through your support. </ul>
    </p>
   <h2>Who we work with</h2>
   <p>
   We provide information on the IATI website about partner organisations that we work with on programmes and projects funded or part-funded by the UK government. At any one time, BET ON BETTER supports around 900 humanitarian and development projects, of which half are fully or mostly implemented with/through partners, and a further 18% have some project activities implemented with/through partners (figures for financial year 2015). We are unable to provide and maintain up-to-date information on all of these partner organisations, but if you require information about the partners that we work with on a specific project or programme, please contact us.
   <ul>
   <li>We work in partnership with local NGOs, community-based organisations and community groups in both our humanitarian and long-term development work.
   <li>We work with government ministries to implement projects and influence policies in favour of poor communities.
   <li>We work with a range of international, national and local organisations and groups on advocacy initiatives.
   <li>We work in partnership with private sector companies when we believe that the partnership will lead to positive outcomes for poor and marginalised people and is in line with our values.</ul>
   </p>
   <h2>Accountability</h2>
   <p>BET ON BETTER is committed to accountable, just and sustainable development that benefits the most vulnerable and excluded communities around the world, especially women and girls. Our organisation-wide Accountability Framework guides the way we capture, report and receive feedback as well as share, learn, and make improvements to our work around the world.
   BET ON BETTER International UK’s inclusive governance team is responsible for supporting BET ON BETTER’s country offices to enable the communities we work with to hold us accountable. Known as ‘forward accountability’ or social accountability, this approach aims to put our primary stakeholders – the people and communities whom we seek to assist – at the very heart of our work.
   The aim is to enable project participants (or intended ‘beneficiaries’) to genuinely understand and influence the programmes from which they ought to benefit, and in this way hold BET ON BETTER accountable. We work to ensure the active involvement of participants (people and communities), and provide opportunities for feedback and dialogue between BET ON BETTER and our participants, at all stages of our programme and project cycles (planning, implementation and evaluation).
   </p>
   <h2>Humanitarian codes of practice</h2>
   <p>In responding to emergencies we are committed to the best practice and continuous improvement. Our commitment to accountability at all stages of emergency preparedness and response is set out in the BET ON BETTER International Humanitarian Accountability Framework. BET ON BETTER is a signatory to internationally accepted humanitarian standards and codes of conduct, in particular the Red Cross and Red Crescent disaster relief code of conduct and the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability. We are a member of the Core Humanitarian Standards (CHS) Alliance, where we provide leadership on establishing accountability mechanisms for crisis-affected people in general and women and girls in particular. Since 2020, BET ON BETTER has been independently verified against the Core Humanitarian Standards for our humanitarian mandate. We are on the board of The Sphere Project which brings together a wide range of humanitarian agencies to promote effective and accountable humanitarian assistance, and we are signatories to the Charter4Change which commits us to support practical changes to the way the humanitarian system operates to enable a more locally-led response. We conduct an annual accountability review as part of our membership of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC).</p>
   <h2>Modern Slavery Act</h2>
   <p>We continue to monitor compliance with the Modern Slavery Act, and the broader issue of modern slavery, across the following areas:
   	<ul>
    <li>Procurement, both UK-based and international
    <li>Selection of programme partners
    <li>HR policies and procedures
    <li>Fundraising and communications.
    </ul>
    We have supported changes to policies and procedures, and incorporated the risks relating to modern slavery into training and capacity building.
    BET ON BETTER is continuing to campaign for a new ILO convention to end violence and harassment in the world of work. We believe that such a convention could also help address issues of modern slavery further down supply chains.
    More details are available in our Statement on Modern Slavery.
